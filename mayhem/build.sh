# python-frontmatter/mayhem/build.sh — build the ELF launcher shims for the Atheris fuzz harness and
# the test runner. python-frontmatter (eyeseast/python-frontmatter) is a PURE-PYTHON package whose
# only runtime dependency is PyYAML: there is no native code to compile or sanitize. The Atheris
# harness (mayhem/fuzz_load.py) is a `.py`, but Mayhem requires the target `cmd:` to be an ELF, so we
# compile a tiny C shim per Python entry point that exec()s `python3 <script>` (see
# mayhem/launcher.c). The Python deps (atheris, the package itself, pytest/toml/pyaml) are installed
# into the image's system Python by the Dockerfile — they need the network and root, which this
# script (re-run offline as the non-root `mayhem` user at the PATCH tier) must NOT require. This
# script only compiles the shims, so it is idempotent and air-gapped (clang, no network).
